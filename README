This MATLAB project evaluates the time-evolution of 
a trapped BEC in a moving lattice. 

We solve the Non-Linear Schrodinger equation given by ...
including correction to the parameters due to the external trap


The elements of the standard NL Schrodinger equation are:

onsite.m              : Hubbard-like on-site interaction
NN_tunneling.m       : Hubbard-like next-neighbour tunneling

and the effects of the trapping potential are evaluated in

onsite_shift.m        : site dependent energy shift due to the trapping potential
NN_tunneling_site.m  : Site-dependent Hubbard-like next-neighbour tunneling


The calculation of the parameters of the tight-binding model from the parameters of the
optical lattice and the dipole trap are implemented here:
